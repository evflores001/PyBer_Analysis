# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to get a summary of fares per city type (i.e., Rural, Suburban, and Urban). The summary includes the total rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride and driver count per city type. This dataframe summary was used to find the sum of fares per city type and date. This dataframe was resampled to render the data on a weekly basis, rather than daily.

## Results:

When creating the initial summary dataframe we get a quick insight onto the differences in total rides, fares, driver count and averages between the city types.

Converting this information into a chart helps distinguish the differences amongst different city types. It is evident that the total amount of fares collected is highest in Urban city types, followed by Suburban, and lastly Rural city types. Though Urban cost per ride and driver are lower than rural and suburban city types, the higher number of rides and drivers yeild a greater revenue. The contrary is observed for Rural city type as fares are much higher and less frequent that the other two city types.

## Summary:

Three business propositions addressing the variance between the city types:
1. Offer promotional pricing to riders in rural areas to increase demand as well as increase driver acquisition.

2. Promote rewards system for frequent/nonfrequent users. This will help client retention and increase.

3. Encourage carpooling programs for Rural and Suburban city types to encourage users to ride more without fear of paying high fees.
